# **Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System (React Native App)**

### **Problem Statement No: 1612**
This mobile application is being developed as a solution to the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Problem Statement: "Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System for Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC)." The problem focuses on automating and optimizing bus scheduling and route planning, which are currently done manually by DTC, resulting in inefficiencies and resource-intensive operations.

---

### **Project Overview**
The **Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System** app is a mobile-based solution developed using **React Native**. The app aims to streamline the process of scheduling DTC buses and managing routes by using advanced algorithms, data analytics, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies.

**Progress:** The app is currently **20% complete**. At this stage, we have successfully implemented the foundational user interface, including the **bottom navigation bar** and core structural components. More features will be integrated soon as the app progresses through its development phases.

### **Problem Description**

**Background:**
The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) currently relies on manual methods for bus scheduling and route planning, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to create an automated software solution capable of handling linked and unlinked duty scheduling and improving route management by mapping all routes and highlighting overlaps with proposed new routes.

---

### **Key Features (To Be Implemented):**
1. **Linked Duty Scheduling:**
   - Assign a specific crew to a bus for their shift.
   - Monitor crew and bus assignments to ensure accountability.
  
2. **Unlinked Duty Scheduling:**
   - Enable handover of buses between crews after completing trips.
   - Manage crew rest periods and reassign buses.

3. **Route Management:**
   - Provide a visual representation of the bus network and all existing routes.
   - Allow users to map new routes and highlight overlaps with current routes.
   - Optimize routes to reduce congestion and enhance service coverage.

4. **Algorithm & Data Analytics Integration:**
   - Use algorithms and data analytics to automate the scheduling process.
   - Optimize resource allocation and route planning using historical data.

5. **Geographic Information System (GIS):**
   - Leverage GIS technologies for real-time mapping and route management.
   - Enable schedulers to visualize and manipulate routes.

### **Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** MongoDB
- **APIs:** GIS API for real-time mapping, custom scheduling algorithms, Google Map Routes
- **Database:** Firebase, AWS
- **Tools & Libraries:** Data analytics and visualization tools, geolocation services.

---

### **Current Development Status (20% Complete):**
- The **bottom navigation bar** is implemented to provide smooth navigation between sections.
- Preliminary work on UI/UX for route management and scheduling modules is complete.
- The basic app structure and navigation logic are in place.

---

### **Future Development:**
- Integration of **algorithm-based scheduling** for linked and unlinked duties.
- Full **GIS-based route mapping** with interactive tools.
- Development of a **scheduler dashboard** for efficient resource management.
- Real-time **data analytics** for route optimization and crew management.
